As the code is (from a fresh clone), everything should work as is. If there is ever a need to reset the serialization,
please comment out line 28, and uncomment line 27 from Bank.main and run the program. Login (with default user found in
Employees.txt) or register a user and log out. Then, re-comment out line 27, and uncomment like 28 and continue to run
the program like that.
Note, upon closing the program from an X button on the frame or exiting through an exception, the serialization will not
save the new state, but instead it will maintain its old state.

To test time-sensitive features, please login as the employee using user: @mark and pass: a, and log in as employee.
Proceed to click set date and choose how many months forward you would like to further the time.
